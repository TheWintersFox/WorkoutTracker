  # Project Description
Workout tracker provides users with a complex overview of their previous workous.  The two options for exercises are Cardio or Resistance.  From here within exercises the user can input the type of exercise, name, duration, weight, reps, sets, distance.  This project is using a MONGODB and Atlas, Express, Mongoose, and Node. This noSQL application delivers the users HTML and API routes through express and express-router.  To deliver chart data chart.js is being used. The app logs multiple exercises and shows progression of the user.  The user can choose to add a new exercise or complete an exercise.  From completing the exercise it will show the users last results on the main index page.  Clicking on Dashboard will show all of the chart data for all exercises currently in the database."
